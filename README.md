### Main files:
1. chat_server.py to start the server
2. chat._cmdl_client.py to start a client

###  Packages Used
* tkinter
* socket
* threading

*Cautious!*\
MacOs 10.14.6 + tkinter -> crash (maybe) \
Solution: update python to a higher version, for example python3.9.

### Further improvement
* Enable sending emoji, files, images
* Better GUI interface (more buttons,more windows )
