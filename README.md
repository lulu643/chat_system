# ICS_project_chatsystem
Main files:
1. chat_server.py to start the server
2. chat._cmdl_client.py to start a client

If your operating system is MacOs 10.14.6, the system might crash when you run this program. The solution is to update you python to a higher version, for example python3.9.

To make the GUI work, the part I changed is in the original chatting program is client_side/chat_client_class.py.
